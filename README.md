## Devlog
Imagine a Scene as a city. GameObjects are the buildings or facilities in the city (such as schools, stores, and parks), 
while Components are the functions and equipment inside these buildings (elevators, water pipes, lights, air conditioners). 
The buildings themselves (GameObject) determine their "existence" in the city, but what truly makes them usable and functional are the devices installed inside (Components). 
And the entire city (Scene) is what organizes these buildings and functions, creating a place where people can live and interact.
